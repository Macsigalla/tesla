#step by step method to push my files from my local repository to github

1) Create a GitHub Repository:

If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this by navigating to github.com, logging in, and clicking on the "+" icon in the top right corner, then selecting "New repository."

2) Initialize Local Repository:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your local repository is stored using the cd command.
If your repository is not yet initialized, you can do so by running:


git init


3) Add Remote URL:

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you created by adding the remote URL. You can obtain the remote URL from your GitHub repository page.

git remote add (any alias name of your choice) <remote_url>

Replace <remote_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

4) Stage Files:

Add the files you want to push to the staging area using the git add command. You can add individual files or use git add . to add all files.
php
Copy code
git add <file1> <file2> ...

5) Commit Changes:

Commit the staged files to your local repository with a descriptive commit message.

git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"


6) Push Changes:


Finally, push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
perl
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command pushes the changes from your local master branch to the remote origin repository. If you're working with a different branch, replace master with the name of your branch.

7) Authenticate (if necessary):

If you haven't authenticated with GitHub on your machine, Git may prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password or access token.

8) Verification:

After the push is completed, visit your GitHub repository page to verify that the files have been successfully pushed.
That's it! Your files should now be pushed from your local repository to your GitHub repository.
